# Code challenge

*To run the code challenge:*

1. `git clone https://github.com/mordra/bcgdigital`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`

*Commandline example:*

`> node dateCalculator "01/01/2000" "01/01/2999"` 

outputs:

`There are exactly 364877 days between the two dates.`

*Package dependencies:*

momentjs - I test against momentjs to make sure my results are correct.

mocha - For a simple test framework that illustrates the point without complicating things.

In my spare time, I explore javascript frameworks. Check out my latest efforts learning react/redux at [Castle of the Winds Remake](https://github.com/mordra/cotwmtor)
